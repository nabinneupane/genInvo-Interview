This is an Web Application that list the most starred Github repos that were created in the last 30 days. 
For this project I used React components along with bootstrap for styling. 

I used following URL to fetch the data from github: https://api.github.com/search/repositories?q=created:%3e2020-05-22&sort=stars&order=desc

 
To run this project you need to install following libraries: 
      1) npm i axios 
      2) npm i react-bootstrap
      3) npm i bootstrap
     
To run the code: 
    npm start
